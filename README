HSFS - an NFS client via FUSE  <steve.shuo.feng@gmail.com>

This was actually an internal training program for the newbies in my
team(a team for file system R&D). We finally got some time to make it
to github just in case someone might be interesting in it......

Now HSFS only supports NFSv3 (RFC1813) and Solaris' extension for
NFSv3 ACL. It can pass LTP file tests and some basic copy-diff scripts
but still lacks lots of NFS features which are already in kennel
implementations such as: Hard link handling Silly rename Clone mount
