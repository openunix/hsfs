Subject: [PATCH v3 0/2] FUSE: Adaptive NFS-like readdirplus support

The original idea belows to Anand V. Avati:

http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=29562240

I did some benchmarking and add the adaptive mechanism as in NFS. For 
the detail of the testing, please refer to:

http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=30305348

In my setup, this patch set can give about 50% performance up with "ls -l"
and without much penalty with pure "ls" because of the second patch. 

Rebased to 3.8-rc3.
