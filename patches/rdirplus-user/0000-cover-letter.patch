Subject: [PATCH V2 0/2] fuse: support readdirplus in lowlevel operations.

This patch set privdes support for readdirplus FUSE user space. It
needs kernel support of the V2 patch from Miklos:

http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=29707811

The patch set is based on Brian's [no_]auto_inval_data patch so I rebased
it to fuse-3.0 and send it as the first patch in the sequence.

Changed in V2
 - Fix a bug in caculating readdirplus entry buffer size

Feng Shuo (2):
  Add '[no_]auto_inval_data' mount option.
  Readdirplus support for fuse_lowlevel_ops
